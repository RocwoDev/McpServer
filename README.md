This uses `uv` so make sure to install it with :
`powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

After cloning the project, execute `crawl4ai-setup` in .venv (activate the environnement)

Never use print or something that STDOUT or you will break the json communication
